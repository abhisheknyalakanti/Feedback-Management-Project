Now for our feedback Managemnet Project,we need two tables.
Create two tables as 
Table1 as register with tuples as

 REGID                                     NOT NULL NUMBER
 FIRSTNAME                                          VARCHAR2(20)
 LASTNAME                                           VARCHAR2(20)
 EMAIL                                              VARCHAR2(20)
 PASS                                               VARCHAR2(20)
 MOBILE                                             NUMBER
 ADDRESS                                            VARCHAR2(30)
 
 table2 as task with tuples as


 TASKID                                    NOT NULL NUMBER
 TASKNAME                                           VARCHAR2(30)
 TASKDATE                                           VARCHAR2(30)
 TASKSTATUS                                         NUMBER(1)
 REGID                                              NUMBER

Ceated the two tables succesfully...
